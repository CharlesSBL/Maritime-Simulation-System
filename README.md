# Maritime Simulation System

## Overview

The Maritime Simulation System is a complex, dynamic simulation environment that integrates port logistics, ship navigation, and resource management. This system leverages modular programming and various design patterns, ensuring flexibility and scalability. It supports a controlled navigation system via tunnels, resource-driven ship construction, and multi-port operations.

### Features

- **Ports and Ships**: Ports function as logistical hubs with capabilities for ship generation, resource management, and unloading processes. Each port can accommodate ships of varying sizes (small, medium, large) and manage different types of resources (gold, wood, meat).
- **Tunnels**: Tunnels restrict ship movement, allowing only five ships at a time, which introduces strategic navigation challenges.
- **Resource Management**: Ports and ships handle essential resources that are crucial for constructing new ships and supporting other operational activities.
- **Factories and Multifactories**: These facilities are responsible for producing ships, resources, and other infrastructure components necessary for port operations. Multifactories enhance production capabilities and efficiency by supporting multiple factories.
